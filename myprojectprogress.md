Right now I am really leaning towards an app that would find the median year of all the songs on
 a spotify playlist so that a person listening to the playlist on shuffle could guess if the next
 song to come on is from before or after the median year.  This could be entertaining for long road
 trips and other stats could also be calculated such as quartiles so that more people could
 participate in the game on a road trip.  Because the work need for this is relatively small a 
common repository would propbably work with each person working on a seperate function of the app.
